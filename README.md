# Bangla Reading Comprehension Based Question Answering using T5 and mT5 Models

This repository contains code and resources for performing Bangla Question Answering using BanglaT5 and mT5 models on the UDDIPOK dataset-a wide-ranging, open-domain Bangla reading comprehension dataset.

## Dataset Overview

The [UDDIPOK dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/s9pb3h2cjy/1) is a novel collection comprising 270 reading passages along with 3636 questions and answers sourced from various materials such as textbooks, exam questions from middle and high schools, newspapers, etc. Its diversity makes it an excellent resource for training and evaluating Bangla language understanding models.

## Models Used
- BanglaT5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)
- mT5 (Multilingual Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)

## Metrics Used for Evaluation
- Character Error Rate (CER)
- Word Error Rate (WER)
- Exact Match (EM)
- BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)
- METEOR (Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit Ordering)
- ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) - Update ROUGE scorer description
